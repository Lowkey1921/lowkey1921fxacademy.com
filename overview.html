          Forex is a portmanteau of foreign currency and exchange. Foreign exchange is the process of changing one
          currency into another currency for a variety of reasons, usually for commerce, trading, or tourism.
          According to a recent triennial report from the Bank for International Settlements a
          global bank for national central banks), the average was more than $5.1 trillion in daily forex trading
          volume.1

          <span>What Is the Forex Market?</span>
          <br>
          <br>
          The foreign exchange market is where currencies are traded. Currencies are important to most people around the
          world, whether they realize it or not, because currencies need to be exchanged in order to conduct foreign
          trade and business. If you are living in the U.S. and want to buy cheese from France, either you or the
          company that you buy the cheese from has to pay the French for the cheese in euros (EUR). This means that the
          U.S. importer would have to exchange the equivalent value of U.S. dollars (USD) into euros. The same goes for
          traveling. A French tourist in Egypt can't pay in euros to see the pyramids because it's not the locally
          accepted currency. As such, the tourist has to exchange the euros for the local currency, in this case the
          Egyptian pound, at the current exchange rate.
          <br>
          <br>
          One unique aspect of this international market is that there is no central
          marketplace for foreign exchange. Rather, currency trading is conducted electronically over-the-counter (OTC),
          which means that all transactions occur
          via computer networks between traders around the world, rather than on one centralized exchange. The market is
          open 24 hours a day, five and a half days a week, and currencies are traded worldwide in the major financial
          centers of London, New York, Tokyo, Zurich, Frankfurt, Hong Kong, Singapore, Paris and Sydney-across almost
          every time zone. This means that when the trading day in the U.S. ends, the forex market begins anew in Tokyo
          and Hong Kong. As such, the forex market can be extremely active any time of the day, with price quotes
          changing constantly.

          <span>A Brief History of Forex </span>
          <br>
          <br>
          Unlike stock markets, which can trace their roots back centuries, the forex market as we understand it today
          is a truly new market. Of course, in its most basic sense-that of people converting one currency to another
          for financial advantage-forex has been around since nations began minting currencies. But the modern forex
          markets are a modern invention. After the accord at Bretton Woods in 1971, more maior currencies were allowed
          to float freely
          against one another. The values of individual currencies vary, which has given rise to the need for foreign
          exchange services and trading.
          <br>
          <br>
          Commercial and investment banks
          conduct most of the trading in the forex markets on behalf of their clients, but there are also speculative
          opportunities for trading one currency against another for professional and individual investors.

          <span>Spot Market and the Forwards & Futures Markets</span>
          <br>
          <br>
          There are actually three ways that institutions, corporations and individuals trade forex: the spot market,
          the forwards market, and the futures market. Forex trading in the spot market has always been the largest
          market because it is the "underlying" real asset that the forwards and futures markets are based on. In the
          past, the futures market was the most popular venue for traders because it was available to individual
          investors for a
          longer period of time. However, with the advent of electronic trading and numerous forex brokers, the spot
          market has witnessed a huge surge in activity and now surpasses the futures market as the preferred trading
          market for individual investors and speculators. When people refer to the forex market, they usually are
          referring to the spot market. The forwards and futures markets tend to be more popular with companies that
          need to hedge their foreign exchange risks out to a specific date in the future.
          <br>
          <br>
          More specifically, the spot market is where currencies are bought and sold according to the current price.
          That price, determined by supply and demand, is a reflection of many things, including current interest rates,
          economic performance, sentiment towards ongoing political situations (both locally and internationally), as
          well as the perception of the future performance of one currency against another. When a deal is finalized,
          this is known as a "spot deal." It is a bilateral transaction by which one party delivers an agreed-upon
          currency amount to the counter party and receives a specified amount of another currency at the agreed-upon
          exchange rate value.After a position is closed, the settlement is in cash. Although the spot market is
          commonly known as one that deals with transactions in the present (rather than the future), these trades
          actually take two days for settlement.
          <br>
          <br>
          Unlike the spot market, the forwards and futures markets do not trade actual
          currencies. Instead they deal in contracts that represent claims to a certain currency type, a specific price
          per unit and a future date for settlement.
          <br>
          <br>
          In the forwards market, contracts are bought and sold OTC between two parties, who determine the terms of the
          agreement between themselves.
          <br>
          <br>
          In the futures market, futures contracts are bought and sold based upon a standard
          size and settlement date on public commodities markets, such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. In the U.S.,
          the National Futures Association regulates the futures market. Futures contracts have specific details,
          including the number of units being traded, delivery and settlement dates, and minimum price increments that
          cannot be customized. The exchange acts as a counterpart to the trader, providing clearance and settlement.
          <br>
          <br>
          Both types of contracts are binding and are typically settled for cash at the exchange in question upon
          expiry, although contracts can also be bought and sold before they expire. The forwards and futures markets
          can offer protection
          against risk when trading currencies.
          Usually, big international corporations use these markets in order to hedge against future exchange rate
          fluctuations, but speculators take part in these markets as well.
          <br>
          <br>
          Note that you'll often see the terms: FX, forex, foreign-exchange market, and currency market. These terms are
          synonymous and all refer to the forex market.

        <div class="lead " class="lefty">
          <br>
          <span>Forex for Hedging</span>
          <br>
          <br>
          Companies doing business in foreign countries are at risk due to fluctuations in
          currency values when they buy or sell goods and services outside of their domestic market. Foreign exchange
          markets provide a way to hedge currency risk by fixing a rate at which the transaction will be completed.
          <br>
          <br>
          To accomplish this, a trader can buy or sell currencies in the forward or swap markets in advance, which locks
          in an exchange rate. For example, imagine that a company plans to sell U.S.-made blenders in Europe when the
          exchange rate between the euro and the dollar (EUR/USD) is €l to $1 at
          parity.
          <br>
          <br>
          The blender costs $100 to manufacture, and the U.S. firm plans to sell it for €150-which is competitive with
          other blenders that were made in Europe. If this plan is successful, the company will make $50 in profit
          because the EUR/USD exchange rate is even. Unfortunately, the USD begins to rise in value versus the euro
          until the EUR/
          USD exchange rate is 0.80, which means it now costs $0.80 to buy €1.00.
          <br>
          <br>
          The problem the company faces is that while it still costs $100 to make the blender, the company can only sell
          the product at the competitive price of €150, which when translated back into dollars is only $120 (€150 X
          0.80 = $120). A stronger dollar resulted in a much smaller profit than
          expected.
          <br>
          <br>
          The blender company could have reduced this risk by shorting the euro and buying the USD when they were at
          parity. That way, if the dollar rose in value, the profits from the trade would offset the reduced profit from
          the sale of blenders. If the USD fell in value, the more favorable exchange rate will increase the profit from
          the sale of blenders, which offsets the losses in the trade.
          <br>
          <br>
          Hedging of this kind can be done in the currency futures market. The advantage for the trader is that futures
          contracts are standardized and cleared by a central authority. However, currency futures may be less liquid
          than the forward markets, which are decentralized and exist within
          the interbank system throughout the world.
          <br>

          <span>Forex for Speculation</span>
          <br>
          <br>
          Factors like interest rates, trade flows, tourism, economic strength, and geopolitical risk affect supply and
          demand for currencies, which creates daily volatility in the forex markets. An opportunity exists to profit
          from changes that may increase or reduce one currency's value compared to another. A forecast that one
          currency will weaken is essentially the same as assuming that the other currency in the pair will strengthen
          because currencies are traded as pairs.
          <br>
          <br>
          Imagine a trader who expects interest rates to rise in the U.S. compared to Australia while the exchange rate
          between the two currencies (AUD/USD) is 0.71 (it takes $0.71 USD to buy $1.00 AUD). The trader believes higher
          interest rates in the U.S. will increase demand for USD, and therefore the AUD/USD exchange rate will fall
          because it will require fewer, stronger
          USD to buy an AUD.
          <br>
          <br>
          Assume that the trader is correct and interest rates rise, which decreases the AUD/USD exchange rate to 0.50.
          This means that it requires $0.50 USD to buy $1.00 AUD. If the investor had shorted the AUD and went long the
          USD, he or she would have profited from the change in value.

          <span>Currency as an Asset Class</span>
          <br>
          <br>
          There are two distinct features to
          currencies as an asset class:
          <br>
          <br>

          <ul>
            <li>You can earn the interest rate differential between two currencies.
            </li>
            <li>You can profit from changes in the exchange rate.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          An investor can profit from the difference between two interest rates in two different economies by buying the
          currency with the higher interest rate and shorting the currency with the lower interest rate. Prior to the
          2008 financial crisis, it was very common to short the Japanese yen (JPY) and buy British pounds (GBP) because
          the interest rate differential was very large.
          This strategy is sometimes referred to as a "carry trade."

          <span>Why We Can Trade Currencies</span>
          <br>
          <br>
          Currency trading was very difficult for individual investors prior to the internet.
          Most currency traders were large multinational corporations, hedge funds or high-net-worth individuals because
          forex trading required a lot of capital. With help from the internet, a retail market aimed at individual
          traders has emerged, providing easy access to the foreign exchange markets, either through the banks
          themselves or brokers making a secondary market. Most online brokers or dealers offer very high leverage to
          individual traders who can control a large trade with a small account balance.
          <br>
          <br>

        <br>
        <div class="lead " class="lefty">
          <br>
          <span>Forex Trading Risks</span>
          <br>
          <br>
          Trading currencies can be risky and complex. The interbank market has varying degrees of regulation, and forex
          instruments are not standardized. In some parts of the world, forex trading is almost completely unregulated.
          <br>
          <br>
          The interbank market is made up of banks trading with each other around the world.
          The banks themselves have to determine and accept sovereign risk and credit risk, and they have established
          internal processes to keep themselves as safe as possible. Regulations like this are industry-imposed for the
          protection of each participating bank.
          <br>
          <br>
          Since the market is made by each of the participating banks providing offers and bids for a particular
          currency, the market pricing mechanism is based on supply and demand. Because there are such large trade flows
          within the system, it is difficult for rogue traders to influence the price of a currency. This system helps
          create transparency in the market for investors with access to interbank dealing.
          <br>
          <br>
          Most small retail traders trade with relatively small and semi-unregulated forex brokers/dealers, which can
          (and sometimes do) re-quote prices and even trade against their own customers. Depending on where the dealer
          exists, there may be some government and industry regulation, but those safeguards are inconsistent around the
          globe.
          <br>
          <br>
          Most retail investors should spend time investigating a forex dealer to find out whether it is regulated in
          the U.S. or the
          U.K. (dealers in the U.S. and U.K. have more oversight) or in a country with lax rules and oversight. It is
          also a good idea to find out what kind of account protections are available in case of a market crisis, or if
          a dealer becomes insolvent.

          <span>Pros and Challenges of Trading Forex</span>
          <br>
          <br>
          <span>Pro:</span> The forex markets are the largest in terms of daily trading volume in the world and
          therefore offer the most liquidity.? This makes it easy to enter and exit a position in any of the major
          currencies within a fraction of a second for a small spread in most market conditions.
          <br>
          <br>
          <span>Challenge:</span> Banks, brokers, and dealers in the forex markets allow a high amount of leverage,
          which means that traders can control large positions with relatively little money of their own. Leverage in
          the range of 100:1 is a high ratio but not uncommon in forex. A trader must understand the use of
          leverage and the risks that leverage introduces in an account. Extreme amounts of leverage have led to many
          dealers becoming insolvent unexpectedly.
          <br>
          <br>
          <span>Pro:</span> The forex market is traded 24 hours a day, five days a week-starting each day in Australia
          and ending in New York. The major centers are Sydney, Hong Kong, Singapore, Tokyo, Frankfurt, Paris, London,
          and New York.
          <br>
          <br>
          <span>Challenge:</span> Trading currencies productively requires an understanding of economic fundamentals and
          indicators. A currency trader needs to have a big-picture understanding of the economies of the various
          countries and their inter-
          connectedness to grasp the fundamentals that drive currency values.

          <span>The Bottom Line</span>
          <br>
          <br>
          For traders - especially those with limited funds - day trading or swing trading in small amounts is easier in
          the forex market than other markets. For those with longer-term horizons and larger funds, long-term
          fundamentals-based trading or a carry trade can be profitable. A focus on understanding the macroeconomic
          fundamentals driving currency values and experience with technical analysis may help new forex traders to
          become more
          profitable.
